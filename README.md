Searches for and removes duplicate songs in your Spotify library.

Spotify Tokens cannot be genereated through the site directly due to CORS restrictions set by GitHub Pages. You will need to generate it yourself at https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-current-user-saved-tracks/ and then paste the result into the Token field.
